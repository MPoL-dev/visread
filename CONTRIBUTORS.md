# Lineage

The code in this package is fairly simple, but it is also built using CASA knowledge gained from a number of collaborators, who are credited in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file. You may also be interested in investigating the [`vis_sample`](https://github.com/AstroChem/vis_sample) and [`UVHDF5`](https://github.com/AstroChem/UVHDF5) packages, as they provide some similar capabilities with additional functionality.
