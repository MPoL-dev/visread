Visread API
===========

Before getting started with the *visread* package, we recommend becoming familiar with the `casatools <https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/casatools.html>`_ provided as part of CASA. You can see some of our highlights in the tutorials and in :ref:`casatools-api-label`.

In this context, the *visread* routines are designed to perform additional processing to the products extracted from measurement sets using casatools.

Process tools 
-------------

The routines in the ``process`` module are generally designed to process quantities extracted using casatools into alternative formats for plotting and analysis.
