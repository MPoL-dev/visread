Visread documentation
=====================

*visread* provides a simple ``read("myFile.ms")`` function to load visibilities from a calibrated CASA Measurement Set file into memory in a Python program. You may wish to plot the baseline distributions, analyze the visibilities themselves, or synthesize images from them using software like `MPoL <https://github.com/MPoL-dev>`_.
