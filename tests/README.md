# Testing for visread

Testing is carried out with `pytest`. You can install the package dependencies for testing via

    $ pip install .[test]

after you've cloned the repository and changed to the root of the repository (`visread`). This installs the extra packages required for testing (they are listed in `setup.py`).

To run all of the tests, from the root of the repository, invoke

    $ python -m pytest
