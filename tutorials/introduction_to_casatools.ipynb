    "# Introduction to Measurement Sets\n",
    "Before you begin, it's worthwhile reviewing the CASA documentation on measurement sets. The basics are [here](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-fundamentals/the-measurementset) and the description of the v2 format is [here](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-fundamentals/measurement-set). To make a long story short, a measurement set (e.g., ``my_ALMA_data.ms``) is a folder containing a set of binary 'tables' with your data and metadata. The contents within this measurement set folder serve as a [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). It helps to keep this structure in mind as we navigate its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASA provides the [casabrowser/browsetable](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/data-examination-and-editing/browse-a-table) tool, which is very handy for graphically exploring the structure and contents of this relational database. If something about the structure of the measurement set doesn't make sense, it's usually a good idea to open up *browsetable* and dig into the structure of the individual tables."
